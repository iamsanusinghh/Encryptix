Sales Prediction using Simple Linear Regression
Project Overview
This project aims to predict sales based on a single feature using simple linear regression. Simple linear regression is a straightforward statistical method that models the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately predict sales based on the input feature.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project likely contains two columns:

Feature (X): The independent variable, which could be factors like advertising budget, number of stores, or any other predictor of sales.
Target (Y): The dependent variable, representing the sales figures.
Example of Dataset Structure
| Feature (X) | Sales (Y) |
|-------------|-----------|
|    230      |   25.4    |
|    345      |   38.6    |
|    290      |   30.2    |
|    ...      |   ...     |

Machine Learning Technique Used
Simple Linear Regression
Model: A linear equation of the form 
ùëå=ùëöùëã+ùëê
Y=mX+c, where 
m is the slope and 
ùëê is the intercept, is fitted to the data to predict the sales (Y) based on the feature (X).
Steps Involved
Data Preprocessing:
Handling missing values (if any).
Visualizing the relationship between the feature and sales using scatter plots.
Model Training:
Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
Training a simple linear regression model on the training data.
Model Evaluation:
Using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared to evaluate model performance.
Visualizing the regression line on the scatter plot of feature vs. sales.

Results
The model successfully fits a linear equation to the data, providing a simple but effective means of predicting sales based on the given feature. Detailed results, including visualizations of the regression line and model performance metrics, are available in the Jupyter Notebook.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of simple linear regression to predict sales. While the model is simple, it provides valuable insights into the relationship between the feature and sales, making it a useful tool for initial predictions and trend analysis.

Future Work
Multiple Linear Regression: Extending the model to include more features to potentially improve prediction accuracy.
Polynomial Regression: Exploring polynomial regression if the relationship between feature and sales is non-linear.
Real-World Application: Deploying the model as part of a sales forecasting tool in a business setting.
